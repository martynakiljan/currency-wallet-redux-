<h1> Currency Wallet </h1>


>from the series:  practicing REACT, REDUX and LOCALSTORAGE,API   :muscle:

----

*My task was to create a "currency wallet" that calculates the potential profit or loss for the currencies held.*

* the user selects the currency
* enters the quantity
* enters the date of purchase
* enters a price

I download with api:
*current exchange rate for the selected currency*


and calculate profit / loss! :sunny:
*(data is saved and retrieved using Local Storage)*

<h1> Currency Wallet </h1>


>from the series:  practicing REACT, REDUX and LOCALSTORAGE,API   :muscle:

----

*My task was to create a "currency wallet" that calculates the potential profit or loss for the currencies held.*

* the user selects the currency
* enters the quantity
* enters the date of purchase
* enters a price

I download with api:
*current exchange rate for the selected currency*


and calculate profit / loss! :sunny:
*(data is saved and retrieved using Local Storage)*

<h3>How to open a file? :eyes: </h3>

* On the right side you will find the "clone or download" button - click it.
* An item should appear with the "Download ZIP" option - click again.
* Now you just need to unpack the downloaded file and open it in your favorite editor.
* and then "go live" is enough
